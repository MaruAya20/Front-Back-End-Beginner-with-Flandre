# Introduction 
Some Front-End and Back-End code which consist to Flandre-TodoList  
obviously, you have to consist those pieces of code...to view this website. But i tnk you don't have to waste your time...  


![Flandre-TodoList](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b7f0fd3-d1a0-4ca3-88df-8247aedf7435)  

## main Code
path:  ./src/App.vue  
ps: yeah, like before the Markdown inside are totally Simplified Chinese.
ps2: this code(especially the markdown...) can be hard to read, it doesn't fit to a totally noob Learner!!!  

## Nothing
Spend not much time, but i got crash by Cursor which can programming with Ai who can easily generate a much better(functionally) Front-End and Back-End code.  
it happens that cursor generate in 10 seconds beat me whom spend tons of hours(actually four or five, not so much , sorry :P)programming this Flandre-TodoList.  
Anyway...I used it generate another better TodoList, maybe i would upload it to another repository....
