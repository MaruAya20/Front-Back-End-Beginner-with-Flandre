## Nothing
Spend not much time,but i got crash by Cursor which can programming with Ai who can easily generate a much better(functionally) Front-End and Back-End code.  
it happens that cursor generate in 10 seconds beat me whom spend tons of hours(actually four or five,not so much)programming this Flandre-TodoList.  
Anyway...I use it generate another better TodoList,maybe i would upload it to another repository....
